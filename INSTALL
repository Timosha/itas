Readme
------

A small module which accepts an HTTP POST and saves the POST variables to the variables
table.

These variables are then available to be used elsewhere in Drupal,
such as in a custom Block. This is an easy way to export external content into Drupal.
This module requires that the FORM contain 'name' and 'pass' parameters.
These parameters must corrospond to the username and password of an active user who has
the 'administer site configuration' permission. The proper Action for the FORM is
index.php?q=variable/save_post.

For example, I have a script which periodically POSTS stats from my Napster server
into this module. These stats are shown in a custom block.

Requirements
------------

This was tested on Drupal 4.0.

Installation
------------

1. Copy the variable.module to the Drupal modules/ directory. Drupal should
   automatically detect it. Then enable the module in Site Configuration -> Modules


Notes
-----

An XML-RPC wrapper around variable_save_post might be useful for some folks, but
a simple POST is sufficient in most (all?) cases.
